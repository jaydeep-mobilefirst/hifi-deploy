                Payout timing varies by location, typically granting access to your platform balance within 2 to 7 business days. In supported regions, the default payout rhythm is automated on a daily basis, ensuring your platform balance is transferred daily upon eligibility. Alternatively, you retain the choice to opt for weekly or monthly payout frequencies based on your preference.
